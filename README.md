## Project statement
The aim is to generate a free scene of a landscape using [Terragen](https://planetside.co.uk/free-downloads/terragen-4-free-download/) software.  

Evaluating criteria will be the textures, atmospheric effects and the composition of the different objects in the scene.  
Terragen is a software oriented to the implementation of landscapes by using fractal algorithms to define the terrain and the clouds, where a pipeline scheme for generating the image will be needed. 

## Installation and execution
1. Download and install [Terragen 4](https://planetside.co.uk/free-downloads/terragen-4-free-download/) (only for Windows).
2. Open the application and load `src/main.tgd` (`File`>`Open`)
3. Render the image (`View`>`Render`>`Render`)

The result should be something like this:

![Result image](img/main.png)
