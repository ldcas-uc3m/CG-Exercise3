## Project statement
The aim is to generate a free scene of a landscape using [Terragen](https://planetside.co.uk/free-downloads/terragen-4-free-download/) software.  

Evaluating criteria will be the textures, atmospheric effects and the composition of the different objects in the scene.  
Terragen is a software oriented to the implementation of landscapes by using fractal algorithms to define the terrain and the clouds, where a pipeline scheme for generating the image will be needed.
